# Rakamin-Kimia-Farma-Big-Data-Analyst-Project
📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Big Data Analytics Internship at Kimia Farma.
The main objective is to evaluate the company’s business performance from 2020 to 2023 using SQL queries and interactive dashboards built with Google Looker Studio.

Through this project, I aim to simulate the role of a Big Data Analyst, transforming raw data into meaningful insights that can support data-driven decision-making.
